# Meteorus

**Meteorus** is a game designed in Python.  
Beta Version 0

## Description

Meteorus is a simple game built with Python and Pygame where players control a ship to shoot projectiles at a bubble. The game is designed as a beta version, showcasing the basic mechanics, which include:  
- Ship movement controlled via keyboard input.
- Shooting projectiles.
- Interactive elements (the bubble that reacts when hit).

## Features

- **Ship Movement:** Control the ship using the arrow keys.
- **Shooting Mechanism:** Fire projectiles with the spacebar.
- **Interactive Bubble:** A bubble that changes state (flashes, blinks, or disappears) after being hit multiple times.
- **Modular Code:** Organized into separate modules (e.g., `ship.py`, `projetil.py`, `bubble.py`, `const.py`), making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install the `pygame` module if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
